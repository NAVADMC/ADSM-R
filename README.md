# ADSM-R
Development for R code for ADSM.
The Animal Disease Spread Model (ADSM: https://github.com/NAVADMC/ADSM/releases/latest) is a stochastic, spatial, state-transition simulation model designed to simulate the between-herd spread and control of highly contagious animal diseases. This is the development spot for R code for ADSM

Our goal is to develop a package of R scripts that can interact with outputs from ADSM.
